# TypeSCript Project Overview
This project is designed to introduce and deepen understanding of TypeScript. It covers a range of topics from basic type declarations to more complex concepts like interfaces, classes, generics, namespaces, and declaration merging. Each task is self-contained within its own directory and includes specific configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js, .eslintrc.js) relevant to that task's requirements.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project one should be able to :
- Basic types in Typescript
- Interfaces, Classes, and functions
- How to work with the DOM and Typescript
- Generic types
- How to use namespaces
- How to merge declarations
- How to use an ambient Namespace to import an external library
- Basic nominal typing with Typescript
